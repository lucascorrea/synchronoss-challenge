# synchronoss-challenge

This is the project to the Synchronoss challenge described below.

## Running:

`CMD + u` will run all test cases via Quick and Nimble

## Build:

- Xcode version  9.3
- Project pattern MVVM
- Swift

From Monday to Friday, I travel by train from Rathdrum to Dalkey in the morning and return in the evening.

Build a mobile app that will be useful for me using the Irish Rail Realtime API: http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/

You can make use of any additional libraries, or services.

Aim to spend a maximum of 5 hours on this so focus on core functionality first (networking, parsing, UI integration). This is an open-ended test so feel free to modify, or interpret, the requirements as you see fit.
